# URL Shortener

This is a URL Shortener built on top of Node, Express and React & Redux. It's a working in progress. Already identified areas that need refactoring.

Features:
  - Give a long URL and we return a shorter one
  - Navigate to the shortened URL and we'll automatically redirect you to the original URL
  - URL was already shortned? It's OK! We'll still find your original URL

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node and Yarn already installed on your machine

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - FAST, RELIABLE, AND SECURE DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

First, setup the code in your local by running bellow command:

```
yarn setup
```

Then, run below command to get started:

```
yarn dev
```

You are now able to open up your browser and navigate to **http://127.0.0.1:3000**

## Running the tests

For running tests, all you need to do is to execute a one of the following commands:

  - server tests:
  Note: Please remember you need to have the server running first so you can run its tests. Bellow command will run the server:
  
  ```
    yarn server
  ```

  and bellow command will run its tests

  ```
    yarn test:server
  ```


  - client tests:
  ```
    yarn test:client
  ```

Remember to always execute these scripts from the root

## Notes:

I decided to use a third-party slug generator to take care of our shortUrl process. The package is called short-id and it creates the unique slugs based on [a-zA-Z0-9] char set. The decision was made basing on the reuse principle. However, I have implemented an idea of how the generation process could be if I have decided not to use third-party libs. You can take a look at the branch "ownSlugGenerator" and check the file slugGenerator.js. There's a self explanatory comment explaining the decisions made in there. Of course, the app would need a few tweaks such as in the method that checks if an url is already shortened, but that could be made in another point. Should you have any questions, please let me know.
